# Image-Segmentation-using-ST-cuts
This is our work for the course project of Medical Image Computing (MIC). Idea is to segment image in two classes using ideas of st graph cuts. For maxflow-min cut we have used the standard  Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm combined with super-pixelisation for image segmentation.
